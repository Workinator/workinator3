1: not being worked on and is due
    worker count = 0 and duedate < now
2: if current assignment exists and has work, return same assignment
3: has work and capacity
    hasWork = true and workerCount < maxWorkerCount
4: any partition that doesn't have a worker
    workerCount = 0
4: if already has an assignment, then keep going.
    like 2, but without the HAS WORK requirement.
    TODO: reconsider this. maybe make it optional, or put in a delay between attempts.
